# Welcome to Project_Secura (to be named)

## **Introduction**

### Project_Secura is an OSS project alternate to [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com), [Bugcrowd](https://bugcrowd.com) and other platforms for ethical hackers to submit vulnerabilities.

<br/>

### Plan to host it No business model yet, but I have 2 main goals with this:

-   ### Provide hackers with the best and most prominent companies.

-   ### Absolute fairness towards hackers, whether that be payments (no commission) or respect (company != bully_hackers).

<br/>

## **Current Status**

-   ### Working on routes/auth/user

---

<br/>

## **Todo** (Adding Soon)

-   ### [->] Finish the user auth routes
-   ### [->] Work on Prisma Schema
-   ### [x] Get the road map ready
-   ### [x] Work on Index page and overall frontend

---

<br/>

## **Tech Stack**

### Technologies used are:

-   ### [Remix](https://remix.run) for the Frontend
-   ### [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) for Styling
-   ### [Supabase](https://supabase.com) for the Backend
-   ### [Prisma](https://prisma.io) as ORM

### The majority of base code is from [Rphlmr's Repo](https://github.com/rphlmr/supa-stripe-stack)

### Technologies used are open for conversation. If you have a compelling reason for changing these, I am open to starting a discussion(_preferred for topics like these_) or opening an issue.
